# Leaflet-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Module 15 Challenge due on 2/11. All of the work present has been created by myself, Molly Pfefferkorn. My instructor, Dr. Carl Arrington, provided troubleshooting feedback during the designated office hours of this class. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
-----------------
For this project, I developed an interactive map to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The task was to create a tool that could help visualize earthquake data in a meaningful way, which would assist the USGS in educating the public and other organizations about global seismic activity. I approached this challenge in two parts, starting with Part 1, where I focused on visualizing earthquake data.

In Part 1, I retrieved a dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, specifically the "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days," which provided earthquake data in JSON format. Using Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps, I created a map that plotted all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The size of each earthquake's marker was scaled according to its magnitude, while the color reflected the depth of the earthquake, with deeper earthquakes displayed in darker colors. I included popups for each marker, displaying additional information about the earthquake, such as its magnitude, location, and depth. To provide context for the map, I added a legend that helped users understand the correlation between depth and color.
In addition to the map itself, I ensured that the dataset was properly connected to the geoJSON API using D3 without any errors. The markers on the map scaled correctly with the magnitude of each earthquake, and the tooltip for each data point included details about the magnitude, location, and depth. All the data points were correctly placed on the map according to their geographic coordinates.

For Part 2, I worked on an optional task that involved visualizing tectonic plates alongside the earthquake data. This allowed me to explore the relationship between tectonic activity and seismic events. I added a tectonic plates dataset from GitHub, allowing me to overlay this data on the same map. I also incorporated multiple base maps and created layer controls that allowed users to toggle between different data layers independently. While this part was optional, it helped enhance my project and demonstrate more advanced mapping techniques.
